# Mutation Observer

Welcome to **Mutation Observer**, a fun way to learn how DOM changes can be observed and logged in real time! This interactive app allows you to explore the JavaScript `MutationObserver` API with buttons that mutate text, colors, and animations.

---

## Overview

**Mutation Observer** is a browser-based app designed to:

- **Track changes** in a target HTML element (`#observable`), such as:
  - Added or removed child elements.
  - Text updates.
  - Attribute modifications.
- **Log all changes** dynamically to an activity log.
- **Interact with attributes**, like adding/removing color or animations, to showcase how the DOM responds in real time.

If you want to learn how browsers can "observe" DOM changes and take action, this app is your perfect hands-on experience!

## How It Works

1. **Target Element**: The app monitors the `<div id="observable">` section for changes.
2. **Mutation Observer**: The `MutationObserver` API tracks:
   - New or removed child elements.
   - Text content changes.
   - Attribute updates like `class` or `style`.
3. **User Actions**: Buttons allow you to trigger DOM mutations.
4. **Real-Time Logging**: All mutations are logged in a scrollable "Mutation Log" for you to see the magic unfold!

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser.
3. Start interacting with the buttons!

## Features

1. **Add Elements**

   - Adds a new paragraph inside the observable area.
   - Logs the action in real time.

2. **Change Text**

   - Updates the text of the first child in the observable area.
   - Demonstrates character data mutation.

3. **Add/Remove Color**

   - Applies or removes a green background color (`colored` class) from the observable area.
   - Logs attribute changes.

4. **Start/Stop Animation**

   - Adds or removes a pulsing animation effect (`animated` class) to/from the observable area.
   - Perfect for showcasing dynamic styling!

5. **Reset Area**

   - Clears all child elements and restores the original content of the observable area.
   - A great way to start fresh.

6. **Reset Log**
   - Clears the mutation log to declutter your screen.

## Instructions for Developers

### Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file with the app structure.
- `style.css`: Handles styling, animations, and layout.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript logic for the `MutationObserver` and button event handlers.

## Key JavaScript Concepts

### MutationObserver

- An API that observes and reacts to DOM changes.

### Configuration Options

```javascript
const config = {
  // Watches for child node additions/removals
  childList: true,
  // Tracks attribute changes
  attributes: true,
  // Observes the entire subtree of the target
  subtree: true,
  // Detects text content changes
  characterData: true
};

Observer Initialization

const observer = new MutationObserver(mutationCallbackFunc);
observer.observe(targetNode, config);

Callback Function

This function processes mutations and logs them in real time:

const mutationCallbackFunc = (mutationsList, observer) => {
  for (const mutation of mutationsList) {
    if (mutation.type === 'childList') {
      logChange(`ChildList Mutated: ${mutation.addedNodes.length} added, ${mutation.removedNodes.length} removed.`);
    } else if (mutation.type === 'attributes') {
      logChange(`Attribute Mutated: ${mutation.attributeName} modified.`);
    } else if (mutation.type === 'characterData') {
      logChange(`Text was Mutated: "${mutation.target.textContent}"`);
    }
  }
};

```
